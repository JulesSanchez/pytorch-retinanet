# pytorch-retinanet

Fork of yhenon/pytorch-retinanet. See their ReadMe for typical use.

Work for my internship at ENSTA Paristech.

Retinanet adapted for macro-classification based on micro detection. Here specifically for Architectural style classification based on detected architectural element.

Hopefully support training with SHAP.
